My solutions for the Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation book http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/index.html

If you are looking here for a bit of help, the best thing to do is read the README in each chapter folder of this repo. In it I will outline what I struggled with and some 'take aways' I discovered when writing the solutions.
While the textbook does provide some solutions and guidance, not all source is provided and you are incouraged to work it out hence this repo.

Chapters 1 to 3 are pretty simple and introductory so I didn't bother uploading them, the real work starts at chapter 4.

# UPDATE
I'm putting this book down for a while, maybe indefinitely.
While I can see the promise of the book I think it would really benifit from having the author/teacher or a TA there to bounce things off.
The purpose of the book is to make you think and that it does, I practically don't have the time to play 'work out the errors' and my lack of experience with Racket is not helping things at all.

I have a pretty fair idea on how to implement a Lisp interpreter from other readings such as SICP et al and I'm currently studying the Make-A-Lisp process https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md
and using C# (my day to day language and host language of the app I want to build the interpreter for) I'll step through the MAL guide and see what I come up with.
