My solutions for the Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation book http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/index.html

If you are looking here for a bit of help, the best thing to do is read the README in each chapter folder of this repo. In it I will outline what I struggled with and some 'take aways' I discovered when writing the solutions.
While the textbook does provide some solutions and guidance, not all source is provided and you are incouraged to work it out hence this repo.

Chapters 1 to 3 are pretty simple and introductory so I didn't bother uploading them, the real work starts at chapter 4.
