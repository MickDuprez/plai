# Chapter 5 Solution

Another tricky chapter that took a while and a bit of research to complete.
The plai-typed language was the biggest hurdle this time but once again I grokked it by the end and learned something new.

This chapter builds on the last by updating the program to use more general expressions rather than just arithmetic.
The best part to take away was the methods of creating, parsing and interpreting calling stored functions.
